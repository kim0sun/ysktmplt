# - Excersise 1.12
Let \(Y_1\) be the number of successes in \(n = 10\) independent trials
where each trial results in a success or failure, and \(\pi\), the
probability of success, remains constant over all trials. Suppose the 4
possible values of \(\pi\) are \(.20, .40, .60\), and \(.80\). We do not
wish to favor any value over the others so we make them equally likely.
We observe \(Y_1 = 7\). Find the posterior distribution by filling in
the simplified table.
